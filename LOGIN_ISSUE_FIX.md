I have identified a critical issue that is causing the login to fail. The backend is not configured correctly because a configuration file is missing.

**To fix the application, you need to create a `.env` file in the `Backend` directory.**

Here are the steps:

1.  Create a new file named `.env` inside the `Backend` directory.
2.  Add the following content to the `Backend/.env` file:

```
USER=postgres
HOST=localhost
DATABASE=keeper_notes
PASSWORD=your_actual_password
PORT=5432
```

3.  **Important:** Replace `your_actual_password` with your actual password for the `postgres` user in your PostgreSQL database.

After you have created and saved the `.env` file, you will need to stop and restart the backend server for the changes to take effect.

I have already installed all the necessary dependencies and have started both the frontend and backend servers for you. Once you create the `.env` file and restart the backend, the login should work.
